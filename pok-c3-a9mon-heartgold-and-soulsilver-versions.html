While the games feature several expansions in key areas, the overall plot follows the same direction as the original <a href=# title="Pokémon Gold and Silver Versions">Gold and Silver</a>. Some aspects exclusive to <a href=# title="Pokémon Crystal Version">Crystal</a> are also included. Like how FireRed and LeafGreen could link up with <a href=# title="Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire Versions">Ruby, Sapphire</a>, and <a href=# title="Pokémon Emerald Version">Emerald</a> to complete the Pokédex by trading regionally exclusive Pokémon, HeartGold and SoulSilver can link up with <a href=# title="Pokémon Diamond and Pearl Versions">Diamond, Pearl</a>, and <a href=# title="Pokémon Platinum Version">Platinum</a> to obtain Pokémon unavailable in Johto and Kanto (such as the <a href=# title="First partner Pokémon">Sinnoh first partner Pokémon</a>) and vice versa.</p><p><a href=# title="Kris (game)">Kris</a>, despite being the female counterpart of <a href=# title="Ethan (game)">Crystal's player character</a>, is not included as the female player character, with a <a href=# title="Lyra (game)">new character</a> instead taking her place. Whether she is chosen to be the <a href=# title="Player character">player character</a> or not, this new character will still appear in the game.

The <a href=# title="Player character">player</a>, either <a href=# title="Ethan (game)">Ethan</a> or <a href=# title="Lyra (game)">Lyra</a>, begins their journey from <a href=# title="New Bark Town">New Bark Town</a>, running an errand for <a href=# title="Professor Elm">Professor Elm</a> to <a href=# title="Mr. Pokémon">Mr. Pokémon</a>'s house to discover what he was so excited about. Elm supplies the player with one of three Pokémon, <a href=# title="Chikorita (Pokémon)">Chikorita</a>, <a href=# title="Cyndaquil (Pokémon)">Cyndaquil</a>, or <a href=# title="Totodile (Pokémon)">Totodile</a>, for this errand. After Mr. Pokémon's discovery turns out to be an <a href=# title="Pokémon Egg">Egg</a>, the player returns to New Bark Town, only to find that a suspicious <a href=# title="Silver (game)">red-haired boy</a> seen lurking outside of Elm's lab earlier has stolen one of Elm's Pokémon— the one that the player's choice is weak to, coincidentally. Upon defeating him and returning to New Bark Town, the player gives the name of the boy (the player can choose any name, provided it fits under the seven-character limit; his name defaults to Soul in HeartGold and Heart in SoulSilver) to a police officer who has come to investigate the incident. Elm is amazed by the Egg and insists on studying it, allowing the player to keep the Pokémon they traveled with as a <a href=# title="First partner Pokémon">first partner Pokémon</a>. From here, he encourages the player to journey across <a href=# title=Johto>Johto</a> and challenge the eight <a href=# title="Gym Leader">Gym Leaders</a>, <a href=# title=Falkner>Falkner</a>, <a href=# title=Bugsy>Bugsy</a>, <a href=# title=Whitney>Whitney</a>, <a href=# title=Morty>Morty</a>, <a href=# title=Chuck>Chuck</a>, <a href=# title=Jasmine>Jasmine</a>, <a href=# title=Pryce>Pryce</a>, and <a href=# title=Clair>Clair</a>, and eventually the <a href=# title="Pokémon League">Pokémon League</a>. With the first Gym in <a href=# title="Violet City">Violet City</a> nearby, the player heads off on their adventure.</p><p>Upon arriving at Violet City, the player must first defeat the Elder, <a href=# title=Li>Li</a>, at <a href=# title="Sprout Tower">Sprout Tower</a> before facing the Violet City Gym. Li has just been defeated by Silver and after the player defeats Li, he gives the player <a href=# title="Flash (move)">Flash</a>. After defeating Falkner for the <a href=# title=Badge>Zephyr Badge</a>, Elm's assistant appears to give the player the Egg, which will later hatch into a <a href=# title="Togepi (Pokémon)">Togepi</a>. Heading south towards <a href=# title="Azalea Town">Azalea Town</a> by way of <a href=# title="Johto Route 32">Route 32</a> and <a href=# title="Union Cave">Union Cave</a>, the player meets up with the villainous <a href=# title="Team Rocket">Team Rocket</a>, formed again after it was disbanded <a href=# title="Generation I">three years prior</a> in the neighboring <a href=# title=Kanto>Kanto</a> region by <a href=# title="Red (game)">a young Trainer</a>. They are cutting off the tails of the <a href=# title="Slowpoke (Pokémon)">Slowpoke</a> that are sacred in Azalea, intending to sell them for a large profit. <a href=# title=Kurt>Kurt</a>, a local maker of specialty <a href=# title="Poké Ball">Poké Balls</a>, is greatly angered by this, and requests the player's help in chasing away Team Rocket and saving the Slowpoke. Though he falls into the <a href=# title="Slowpoke Well">Slowpoke Well</a>, hurting himself in the process, he begs the player to continue on to fight the organization with their Pokémon. After this has been done, and Team Rocket is chased away from Azalea, Kurt gives the player a <a href=# title="Lure Ball">Lure Ball</a> and will make his specialty Poké Balls when brought any kind of <a href=# title=Apricorn>Apricorn</a>, once per day. After defeating <a href=# title=Bugsy>Bugsy</a> in the <a href=# title="Azalea Gym">Azalea Gym</a> for the <a href=# title=Badge>Hive Badge</a> and defeating the red-haired boy (Silver) once again, the player can journey into <a href=# title="Ilex Forest">Ilex Forest</a> to find the <a href=# title=Charcoal>Charcoal</a> maker's <a href=# title="Farfetch'd (Pokémon)">Farfetch'd</a> and get <a href=# title=HM01>HM01</a> (<a href=# title="Cut (move)">Cut</a>). With this, Ilex Forest can be navigated through towards <a href=# title="Johto Route 34">Route 34</a>. On Route 34, a <a href=# title="Pokémon Day Care">Pokémon Day Care</a> is set up that is capable of raising two Pokémon at once. The Day Care functions the same way as in other <a href=# title="Generation IV">Generation IV</a> games.</p><p>Venturing into <a href=# title="Goldenrod City">Goldenrod City</a>, the player's third Badge, the <a href=# title=Badge>Plain Badge</a>, awaits. After defeating <a href=# title=Whitney>Whitney</a> and getting the Plain Badge, getting a <a href=# title="Squirt Bottle">SquirtBottle</a> allows the player to move the <a href=# title="Sudowoodo (Pokémon)">strange tree</a> blocking <a href=# title="Johto Route 36">Route 36</a> to the north. If it is <a href=# title="Days of the week">Tuesday, Thursday, or Saturday</a>, the <a href=# title="Bug-Catching Contest">Bug-Catching Contest</a> will be on at the <a href=# title="National Park">National Park</a> on <a href=# title="Johto Route 35">Route 35</a> as well. In <a href=# title="Ecruteak City">Ecruteak City</a>, <a href=# title=Bill>Bill</a>, the developer of the <a href=# title=PC>PC</a> <a href=# title="Pokémon Storage System">Pokémon Storage System</a> is performing repairs on the <a href=# title="Time Capsule">Time Capsule</a>, and as the player arrives, he will finish, asking for them to come visit him in his parents' house in Goldenrod, where he will give away an <a href=# title="Eevee (Pokémon)">Eevee</a>. Another Gym is in Ecruteak City, where the <a href=# title="Ghost (type)">Ghost-type</a> Leader <a href=# title=Morty>Morty</a> battles for the <a href=# title=Badge>Fog Badge</a>. The player encounters the <a href=# title="Legendary beasts">Legendary beasts</a> in the <a href=# title="Burned Tower">Burned Tower</a> and they <a href=# title="Roaming Pokémon">run off</a> around Johto. The player also meets <a href=# title=Eusine>Eusine</a> who is studying the Burned Tower and takes interest in <a href=# title="Suicune (Pokémon)">Suicune</a>.</p><p>The player goes on through <a href=# title="Johto Route 38">Route 38</a> and <a href=# title="Johto Route 39">Route 39</a> to arrive in <a href=# title="Olivine City">Olivine City</a>. Once there, they learn from Silver that <a href=# title=Jasmine>Jasmine</a>, the Gym Leader, is not available at the moment, since she is taking care of the <a href=# title="Olivine Lighthouse">lighthouse's</a> <a href=# title=Amphy>Ampharos</a> and refuses to leave until the Pokémon is given a <a href=# title="Secret Medicine">special medicine</a> from <a href=# title="Cianwood City">Cianwood City</a>. The player thus surfs their way through <a href=# title="Johto Route 40">Route 40</a> and <a href=# title="Johto Route 41">Route 41</a> to get to Cianwood City. There, they encounter the <a href=# title="Fighting (type)">Fighting-type</a> Leader <a href=# title=Chuck>Chuck</a>, who presents the player with the <a href=# title=Badge>Storm Badge</a>. They get the medicine from the Cianwood Pharmacy and go back to Olivine City. Jasmine, relieved after getting her Ampharos's medicine, goes back to taking Gym challenges. Her Pokémon specialty is of the <a href=# title="Steel (type)">Steel</a> type. When the player gets their sixth Badge, the <a href=# title=Badge>Mineral Badge</a>, they travel to <a href=# title="Mahogany Town">Mahogany Town</a>, through <a href=# title="Johto Route 42">Route 42</a>. The Gym is blocked by a man and the way to <a href=# title="Johto Route 44">Route 44</a> and the <a href=# title="Ice Path">Ice Path</a> is blocked by a man trying to sell <a href=# title="Rage Candy Bar">Rage Candy Bars</a>.</p><p>The player heads north to <a href=# title="Johto Route 43">Route 43</a> and the <a href=# title="Lake of Rage">Lake of Rage</a>. Upon entering the gate, two Team Rocket Grunts charge them <a href=# title="Pokémon Dollar"><span class=pdollar>$</span></a>1000 to go through. When the player gets to the lake, they encounter the <a href=# title="Red Gyarados">Red Gyarados</a>. After the player defeats, catches or flees from it, they get the <a href=# title="Red Scale">Red Scale</a>. A caped man named <a href=# title=Lance>Lance</a> appears on the shore and reveals Team Rocket's secret hideout to the player. The player goes back to Mahogany and goes through the hideout, along with Lance. Team Rocket planned to emit sound waves, inducing the <a href=# title="Magikarp (Pokémon)">Magikarp</a> in the lake to evolve into <a href=# title="Gyarados (Pokémon)">Gyarados</a>, which caused the effect of the <a href=# title="Red Gyarados">Red Gyarados</a>. Once the player defeats all the Team Rocket members and disables the wave-emitting machine, they can challenge <a href=# title=Pryce>Pryce</a>, the town's <a href=# title="Ice (type)">Ice-type</a> Gym Leader.</p><p>Upon defeating the Gym Leader and obtaining the <a href=# title=Badge>Glacier Badge</a>, the player receives a phone call from Prof. Elm about a strange radio signal emitted by Team Rocket, trying to connect with their missing leader, <a href=# title=Giovanni>Giovanni</a>. The player goes to the <a href=# title="Goldenrod Radio Tower">Goldenrod Radio Tower</a> to investigate. Once there, a Team Rocket Grunt tells the player that only Team Rocket members are permitted to enter the tower. The player then goes into the tunnel, where a Team Rocket Grunt says they are looking for new recruits, then dresses the player in a Team Rocket grunt's uniform. The player is then permitted to enter the tower, but, all of a sudden, Silver enters, and tells the player off for thinking they look tough in the clothing. The player finds out the tower has been taken over by Team Rocket. When the player ascends to the top floor, they find the director of the Radio Tower, only to discover that he has been impersonated by a member of Team Rocket and that the real Director is locked in Goldenrod's basement. Once the player enters the basement, they are once again encountered by Silver, who intends to defeat Team Rocket all by himself. He still questions the way he treats his Pokémon.
