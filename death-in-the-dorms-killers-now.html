Produced by ABC News Studios, Death in the Dorms is a <a href=#>Hulu</a> series that takes a look at six tragic murders at six different colleges. That's right, the themes are killing and college. (At least they didn't go with Murder U.)</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Unfortunately, very little can be done for the victims of these killings, apart from sharing their stories without their consent, so we'd like to know exactly what happened to the individuals who murdered them. Like pawing through a garbage can looking for the retainer you accidentally threw out, we're gonna dig into where the killers from Death in the Dorms are now. Equally as important is a question you should ask yourself: Should brutal killings be organized using a motif?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Alberto Medina</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>In the affluent neighborhood of Westwood, Calif. sits the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). As one student told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ABC News</a>, it "feels safe." But in September 2015, 21-year-old Andrea DelVesco was set on fire in her apartment after being stabbed to death. The fire was meant to hide any evidence.</p><p>Alberto Medina was a student at Fresno State University who broke into DelVesco's apartment, <a href=#>burglarized</a> it, then stabbed her 19 times. The stolen items led to his arrest and conviction. He is currently serving a life sentence without parole.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Pedro Bravo</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>University of Florida freshman Christian Aguilar began dating Erika Friman in August 2012. The only person who had a problem with this was 20-year-old Pedro Bravo, who not only used to date Erika but had also been friends with Christian since 8th grade, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ABC News</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In a detailed and disturbing journal, Bravo filled page after page with entries about his love for Erika and his plans to win her back. When he couldn't do that, he looked up "murder statistics, alibis, and <a href=#>fatal doses of sleeping pills</a>." Aguilar's remains were found duct taped. It's believed he was poisoned by Bravo, who was found guilty in August 2014 and sentenced to life in prison.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">George Wesley Huguely V</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>The murder of University of Virginia student Yeardley Love was widely publicized. In May 2010, the 22-year-old lacrosse player was found <a href=#>beaten to death</a> in her Charlottesville, Va. apartment. Her boyfriend, George Wesley Huguely V, would later be convicted of second-degree murder and given a 23-year prison sentence.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CBS News</a>, during his testimony, Huguely apologized to Love's mother and sister.

In 2017, the four brothers <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">plead guilty to concealing evidence</a>. Each received prison sentences, though Lam got time served.

Sadly, the person behind the wheel was not her <a href=#>Uber driver</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Nathaniel Rowland stabbed her 120 times and dumped her body 65 miles away in a "remote area of Clarendon County," reported <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>.

Three days later, she died from complications due to her injuries.</p><p>Authorities later arrested Lucas Goodrum (then 21) and Stephen Soules (20) of Bowling Green, Ky.
