For all intents and purposes, though, <a href=#>Alba walked away from acting</a> as a career a while ago.</p><p>She explained the reasoning behind this in an interview last year, where she pointed to the tough balancing act of <a href=#>being a successful businesswoman</a>, a mother to her three children, and a professional actor all at the same time.</p><p>The decision to quit acting was not a permanent one, however, and she is due to return to the big screen in an upcoming action thriller movie going by the title Trigger Warning.</p><p>Alba will be hoping the second phase of her career can surpass the heights of her first. One of her biggest roles before was in the sci-fi drama series Dark Angel, which aired on Fox between 2000 and 2002.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Fans Are Ecstatic Over Zac Efron’s First TikTok Ever With Jessica Alba</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The role wasn’t all smooth sailing, though, as she reportedly <a href=#>had a rough time working with co-star Jensen Ackles</a> on the set of the show.</p><h2 id=jessica-alba-starred-as-max-guevara-in-lsquo-dark-angel-rsquo>Jessica Alba Starred As Max Guevara In ‘Dark Angel’</h2><p>Dark Angel was created by legendary director James Cameron, who had started to develop various concepts for television on the back of his success with Titanic in 1997.

For 115 episodes between 1997 and 2000, he portrayed the character Eric Brady.</p><p>After he left Days of Our Lives, Ackles started pursuing new opportunities on television. He featured in a CBS biographical film called Blonde, which starred Australian actress Poppy Montgomery as Marylin Monroe.</p><p>He also <a href=#>auditioned for the lead role Clark Kent</a> / Superman in The WB’s Smallville, a part that he lost out to Tom Welling. Ackles would later on appear on the show in a different role a few years later.</p><p>It wasn’t too long after his time on Days of Our Lives that the Texas-born star was cast in Dark Angel.
