She's still very active in Hollywood these days with voice over work on plenty of top tier shows such as Family Guy, American Dad! and Praise Petey.</p><p>However, despite all the success, most fans remember Paget for her time on Friends, playing the role of Chandler and Joey's ex-girlfriend, Kathy. She appeared in six episodes of the show between 1997 and 1998. Ultimately, although the actress wishes she could've stuck around longer, her time was cut short after her character Kathy cheats on Chandler while in a play with another actor. It put an end to her time on the show but at the very least, things got better with Joey and Chandler.</p><p>Nowadays, the former Friends star is still active on social media. Fans couldn't get over her new look, especially in comparison to her days on Friends sporting shorter hair.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>The Friends Storyline Matthew Perry Stepped In And Banned From The Show</a></span></p><p>Similar to other guest stars, Brewster had a lot to say about her time on the show.

Bright also wrote out a statement combined towards the late actor.</p><p>"He was a brilliant talent. Itâs a cliche to say that an actor makes a role their own, but in Matthewâs case, there are no truer words. From the day we first heard him embody the role of Chandler Bing, there was no one else for us. We will always cherish the joy, the light, the blinding intelligence he brought to every moment â not just to his work, but in life as well. He was always the funniest person in the room. More than that, he was the sweetest, with a giving and selfless heart.â</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Without a doubt, Matthew Perry will be missed by millions of fans and those he formed friendships with.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGinmp%2BVqXqjvsSwqq2domKwqa3NnaOeqqNisrl5z6uYoquVmXqjxYyfqaKdnpnAbrLAp6pmnp%2Bneqmx0Wabop6Wmr%2BmutNmo6inm2KurbiMrZ%2Beq5Vixqat0axkpZmkmr9w</p></div><div id=links><a href=./is-kahiau-machado-gay-wikipedia-bio-relationship.html>&#171;&nbsp;Is Kahiau Machado Gay?
