Moreover, between August 23 and 25, 2018, he tamed the YouTube algorithm. It is because he went from 90,000 subscribers to 200,000. This was because a bigger YouTuber named Cody Ko uploaded a video about 5-Minute Crafts.</p><p>In this case, Cody indirectly helped him in gaining more recognition because Johnson uploaded a rant video about the same channel. That video did show up often in the recommendations of Cody’s video since it was a pretty similar video.</p><p>Talking about his video content, he uploads real-life tutorials, creates comedy/entertainment videos, and tech videos about his software engineering career, and rants about channels that he doesn’t like. This includes 5-Minute Crafts, Troom Troom, BRIGHT SIDE, and animated storytime channels like Share My Story and HAPPENED.</p><p>Sometimes, he also uses these “Life Hacks” as a video idea, making videos trying to do said “Hacks”. He even created a channel called “THEY ANIMATED MY STORY” as a satirical parody channel mocking the aforementioned storytime channels by creating exaggerated stories. Additionally, he is also famous for his tech and entertainment vlogging just like another Youtuber Nathan Zed.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-37433 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Jarvis-Johnson-Youtube-achievement.jpg alt="Jarvis Johnson" width=650 height=683 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-37433 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Jarvis Johnson received the Youtube golden play button for crossing a million subscribers on his channel in October 2019.
