Her lips appear to be doing calisthenics as she forms words, and her eyes widen whenever she makes a wry comment — like when she says she expected to be working at Starbucks, instead of starring in films. At the time of the interview, she had yet to announce her pregnancy with her husband, Parks and Rec actor Chris Pratt, and there was certainly no evidence on her diminutive frame. As she curled up on a lushly upholstered couch at the Waldorf Astoria while promoting<i> </i>the Sacha Baron Cohen fascist romp <i>The Dictator</i>, Faris talked about her role as a crunchy Brooklyn cause-haver, her dreams for a remote theater refuge in the Pacific Northwest, and playing idiots.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-56479bdf17e462ed4f7bb18ad28dff2a-3-0-0@published data-word-count=21><b>I saw The Dictator last night.

But yeah, I loved sort of playing a character that’s not vain, and clearly not too concerned with the aesthetic end. And I think part of the comedy is that his character has never met or known a girl like that. For me, it was awesome. It was great.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-56479bdf17e462ed4f7bb18ad28dff2a-11-0-0@published data-word-count=89><b>Did he write it with you in mind?</b><br>I don’t think so, no.

I don’t think anybody really wants to know their limits. I think I’d like to think I play all kinds of roles. I don’t know if I can or not, but I like to explore that idea. But I do feel really lucky because I feel like compared to a lot of actors, I have been able to play — I mean, it’s all sort of mostly in the comedy world — but a lot of different types of people; some insane people, some really awful people, mostly all really dumb people. So yeah, I feel pretty fortunate in that. And I think that though, the big thing with that in Hollywood with sort of breaking that idea is time. It just takes time to build up a repertoire with roles.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-56479bdf17e462ed4f7bb18ad28dff2a-16-0-0@published data-word-count=51><b>Is there anything that you’d <b>especially</b> like to do?</b><br>Well, there’s characters on my mind that I want to play, that I want to create and develop.

But I guess you just sort of move forward.

I mean, I think it’s still scary for Hollywood to sort of commit money to a messy woman. And to a lesser extent, but to some degree, a messy guy as well. But yeah, I do think it’s shifted the conversation because it used to be the conversation when I was pitching movies was always like, “Well, what’s it rated?” And if we said R it was like, “Well, no, it’s got to be PG-13.” Or, either that or the conversation was like, “How do we make this girl likable?” So then you’re forced with the burden of like, winning. You know, the whole cliché is like you want the women in the audience to want you to be their best friend, and the men in the audience to fall in love with you. That’s a whole hell of a lot to be saddled with, and it’s very limiting.

I think we probably need to update the script and work on that a little bit, but with any project, you know it goes through waves of momentum.

There is a feeling of camaraderie, and the feeling is, like, isn’t this sort of impossible, isn’t this sort of hard? Well, let’s doing something together, wouldn’t it be cool, will you come do a little thing in my movie? It’s an empowering feeling, which is great.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-56479bdf17e462ed4f7bb18ad28dff2a-34-0-0@published data-word-count=106><b>Who are the actresses that are in that world?</b><br>Well, like Zooey Deschanel, and Rashida [Jones], and Amy Poehler, and Abby Elliott, and Kristen Wiig — I mean, she’s on a different level. I don’t know, but she’s like scraping around. The cool thing, though, she’s such a leader and supporter of that kind of collaboration. So, that’s really amazing. It’s just nice when you see these actresses and you’re friends with them and they’re like, I like that person, love to work with them, and I think we just all have each other’s backs. And maybe I’m naive in that way, but it feels like that.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-56479bdf17e462ed4f7bb18ad28dff2a-35-0-0@published data-word-count=32><b>You were talking about the women who are in that comedy circle. Who do you think are your peers in terms of when you go up for roles?</b><br>Oh, I have no idea.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-56479bdf17e462ed4f7bb18ad28dff2a-36-0-0@published data-word-count=109><b>No idea?</b><br>I have no idea. I mean, I really don’t. Part of it is because I don’t ask because I don’t really want to know. Part of it is ‘cause it changes all the time, and part of it is, too, I think it’s … I feel like I’ve done enough, so people either know that they want me or they know if they don’t. It’s kind of interesting. But when I was first starting out, it was, like, all the <i>American Pie</i> girls; I was always losing jobs to all of them, I remember. It just, like, shifted; every six months it was somebody else. It was funny.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-56479bdf17e462ed4f7bb18ad28dff2a-37-0-0@published data-word-count=130><b>Before you go back to London to shoot, tell me a little bit about <i>I Give it a Year</i>.</b><br>It’s directed by Dan Mazer, who executive produced this movie, <i>The Dictator</i>, and he’s been with Sasha [Baron Cohen] for a long time. I love that it’s very British in that all of the dialogue is very quick, and witty, and fun to say, and it’s all very dialogue-based humor. There’s nobody slipping and falling on a fucking bra or whatever. So that’s a great sort of change of pace. It’s very actor-y. It’s been a while since I’ve done a movie with like three other really professional, amazing actors. It’s really rewarding to sit around and laugh and play with these people who are all&nbsp; so good at what they do.</p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Anna Faris on The Dictator and Playing Idiots</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWloa2dganyius2aZJ%2BZop7AbsDHnmSdoZOprrW70Wagp6yVp8OqsdZnn62lnA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./dematrius-davis-elite-long-sleeve-tee.html>&#171;&nbsp;Dematrius Davis &amp;quot;Elite&amp;quot; Long Sleeve Tee</a>
