Malabar is a traditional cuisine of Kerala which is generally prepared out of chicken, beef or fish. The fusion of traditional Malabar cuisine with Paneer was not favoured by the people on social media and they slammed him for giving a north Indian twist to the dish. In an interview, he said,</p><p>I was sad and disappointed over the unwanted controversy but I have not tried to defend myself amidst all the allegations because I know I have not done anything wrong. My father had once told me not to waste my energy in trying to pull people down.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Awards_Honour_Achievement></span>Awards, Honour, Achievement<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>1993: The Mercury Gold Award at IFCA (Indian Federation of Culinary Associations), Geneva for Best Meal Concept and Creation</li></ul><ul><li>1995: Best Executive Chef in India by Food Service India <img data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/getbiography.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sanjeev-Kapoor-with-his-award-Best-Executive-Chef-1.jpg http viewbox style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-106281 class=wp-caption-text>Sanjeev Kapoor with his award Best Executive Chef</p></li></ul><ul><li>2002, 2004, and 2010: ITA Award For Best Cookery Show Khana Khazana</li></ul><ul><li>2006: Brand Leadership award at 5th Indira Awards for Marketing Excellence</li></ul><ul><li>2008: National Award for Best Chef of the Year by the Government of India</li></ul><ul><li>2015: ITA Award for Popular Chef and Entrepreneur</li></ul><ul><li>2015: Most Celebrated Chef Of The Year Award at Hozpitality Excellence Awards</li></ul><ul><li>2017: Padma Shri award, the fourth highest Indian national honour for his contribution to uplifting Indian cuisine <img data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/getbiography.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sanjeev-Kapoor-being-awarded-with-Padma-Shree.jpg http viewbox style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-106091 class=wp-caption-text>Sanjeev Kapoor was awarded Padma Shree by honourable President, Pranav Mukherjee</p></li></ul><ul><li>&nbsp;In 2021, Sanjeev Kapoor was approached to be the guest of honour at Flavours of Punjab, Chandigarh.</li></ul><ul><li>2017: Achieved the Guinness World Record by cooking 918 kg khichdi live at World Food India Event, New Delhi <img data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/getbiography.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sanjeev-Kapoor-while-making-the-record-breaker-Khichdi.jpg http viewbox style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-106094 class=wp-caption-text>Sanjeev Kapoor while preparing Khichdi with his team</p></li></ul><ul><li>2017: Hall Of Fame Award by The Institute of Hotel Management</li></ul><ul><li>2017: Times Chef of the Year Award by Times Food Awards</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Net_Worth></span>Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sanjeev Kapoor’s ventures are valued at over Rs 1,000 crore by his existing investors.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Favourites></span>Favourites<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li><strong>Food(s):</strong>&nbsp;Mishti Doi, Biryani, Laksa,&nbsp;and Thai curry</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Actor: </strong>Amitabh Bachchan</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Destination:</strong> New Zealand</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=FactsTrivia></span>Facts/Trivia<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li class=q-relative>In 2010, Sanjeev Kapoor was listed at No. 31 in Reader’s Digest which is an American general-interest family magazine in 100 of India’s Most Trusted persons.</li></ul><ul><li>Sanjeev Kapoor was selected as one of the members on the board of Singapore Airlines International Culinary Panel along with eight other chefs.</li></ul><ul><li>Sanjeev Kapoor is famous for doing live food events and cooking demonstrations all across the globe.</li></ul><ul><li>Sanjeev is also known as the ‘Rachel Ray of India.’</li></ul><ul><li>In 2015, Sanjeev Kapoor was chosen to cook a royal vegetarian feast for Prime Minister Narendra Modi at a dinner hosted by the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority.</li></ul><ul><li>Sanjeev was ranked 73 in 2016 and 34 in 2017 on Forbes India Celebrity 100 list.</li></ul><ul><li>The cooking show Khana Khazana hosted by Sanjeev Kapoor was originally named ‘Shriman Bawarchi.’</li></ul><ul><li>While pursuing graduation from the Institute of Hotel Management Catering and Nutrition, Sanjeev Kapoor took part in the catering and food service department for about 6000 athletes in the Asian Games held in Delhi in 1982.</li></ul><ul><li>Sanjeev Kapoor is the brand ambassador for Sweekar Advanced, a sunflower oil brand in India, Tata i-Shakti Dals, Dalda Vanaspati, Washington Apples, and Leonardo Olive Oil.</li></ul><ul><li>Sanjeev has been actively supporting and raising funds for the NGO, “Forum for Autism.” He also employs people with autism in his company in order to support them and their families.</li></ul><ul><li>In the first episode of Khana Khazaana, Sanjeev cooked two dishes Shaam Savera and chicken breast stuffed with saffron cream cheese.</li></ul><ul><li>Apart from cooking, Sanjeev Kapoor has a special interest in music.
