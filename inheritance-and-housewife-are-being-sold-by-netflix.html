In addition to a wide selection of films and movies, Netflix began releasing original content, which viewers loved. According to Statista, this streaming platform had approximately <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">231 million paid subscribers</a> across the world as of 2022. Despite its popularity, Netflix has been heavily criticized by many of its users in more than one occasion.</p><p>In 2016 a Netflix subscriber sued the company over the sudden price increase. Although the was dismissed, this had become one of the biggest criticism against this streaming site over the years. Its original price was $7.99, then it went up to $9.99, although old customers were able to keep the original pricing until 2016. Nowadays, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Netflix’s standard service is now priced at $15.49 per month</a>, while the premium costs $19.99. Although the streaming platform also offers two other, more affordable, plans, customers have bashed them because of their low quality and the addition of adds.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another big criticism against Netflix has been the fact that the company seemed to prefer quantity over quality when it comes to its original content. Many of Netflix’s most recent shows and movies have been highly criticized both by viewers and the critics for their low quality. Still, the streaming service continues to launch countless new shows and films every year, with very few of them being well-crafted.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Most Underrated Netflix Releases Of 2022</a></span></p><h2 id=netflix-rsquo-s-ceo-says-that-they-rsquo-ve-never-canceled-a-popular-show>Netflix’s CEO Says That They’ve Never Canceled A Popular Show</h2><p>Finally, subscribers constantly bash Netflix for canceling popular shows out of the blue. The company’s <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CEO told Bloomberg that this wasn’t the case</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“We have never canceled a successful show. A lot of these shows were well-intended but talk to a very small audience on a very big budget. The key to it is you have to be able to talk to a small audience on a small budget and a large audience at a large budget. If you do that well, you can do that forever.”</p><p>However, in 2019, it was revealed that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Netflix sees little value in shows with more than 30 episodes</a> which typically equates to three seasons. This is because these shows become too expensive and are harder for newer viewers to jump into. Although this is better for Netflix from a business point of view, it’s easy to understand why fans get upset when their favorite shows get canceled all of a sudden.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Netflix Might've Made A Big Mistake Cancelling A Show That Has A 100% Approval Rating On Rotten Tomatoes</a></span></p><h2 id=netflix-is-trying-to-sell-these-two-never-released-original-movies>Netflix Is Trying To Sell These Two Never-Released Original Movies</h2><p>Most recently, The Hollywood reporter announce that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">two new Netflix movies will never see the light of day</a>:</p><p>The Inheritance and House/Wife .
