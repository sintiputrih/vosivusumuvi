The Explosive Twist in Outer Banks Season 2</h1><div id=sub-header>March 2024 · 4 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><p>Ward Cameron (Charles Esten) is the main antagonist of Outer Banks, a Netflix series that follows a group of teenagers who are searching for a legendary treasure. Ward is a wealthy and powerful businessman who will stop at nothing to get his hands on the gold, even if it means killing, lying, and betraying his own family. But in season 2, he faces the consequences of his actions, and seemingly meets his end in a dramatic explosion. But is Ward Cameron actually dead, or did he pull off another trick to escape justice? Here’s what you need to know.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The Confession and the Explosion</h3><p>In season 2, Ward’s crimes catch up with him, as the State Bureau of Investigation (SBI) raids his home and arrests his son Rafe (Drew Starkey) for the murder of Sheriff Peterkin (Adina Porter). Ward decides to take the blame for everything, and records a video confession where he admits to killing John B’s (Chase Stokes) father, Big John (Charles Halford), Gavin (Adam Vernier), the pilot who helped him transport the gold, and Peterkin. He also claims that he hated being a Pogue, and that he did everything to protect his Kook lifestyle.</p><p>Ward then puts on a white suit and goes to his boat, The Druthers, where he is surrounded by the police and the SBI. He tells them to watch his video, and then detonates a bomb that blows up his boat and himself. His daughter Sarah (Madelyn Cline) and the rest of the Pogues witness the explosion from the dock, and are shocked and horrified by Ward’s apparent suicide.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The Fake Death and the Escape</h3><p>However, in episode 9, it is revealed that Ward is not dead, but alive and well. He faked his own death by using scuba gear to swim away from the boat before the explosion. He then reunites with his wife Rose (Caroline Arapoglou), his daughter Wheezie (Julia Antonelli), and Rafe, who is released from jail thanks to Ward’s confession. They board a cargo ship that is headed to Guadeloupe, where they plan to start a new life with the gold.</p><p>Ward also kidnaps Sarah, who had run away with John B and the Pogues, and brings her to the ship. He tells her that he loves her and that he wants her to be with them. He also lies to her that John B abandoned her after getting the cross, another piece of the treasure. Sarah does not believe him, and tries to escape. She eventually finds John B and the Pogues, who had sneaked on board the ship to rescue her.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The Final Showdown and the Cliffhanger</h3><p>In the final episode, Ward confronts Sarah and John B on the deck of the ship, and tries to kill them. He tells Sarah that she is not his daughter anymore, and that he can’t let her go because she knows too much. He chokes her, but John B intervenes and fights him. John B manages to hit Ward with a metal rod, causing him to fall and hit his head on the edge of the ship, just like he did to Big John.</p><p>Ward falls into the water, and is presumed dead by Sarah and John B. They hug each other, and celebrate their victory. However, in the last scene of the season, it is shown that Ward is still alive, and that he is floating in the ocean, holding on to a piece of wood. He looks at the ship, and says “I’m coming for you” with a menacing tone.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The Conclusion</h3><p>Is Ward Cameron actually dead? The answer is no, he is not. He survived the explosion, the kidnapping, and the fall. He is still after the gold, and he is still after Sarah and John B. He is a ruthless and relentless villain, and he will not give up easily. Outer Banks season 2 ends with a cliffhanger, and sets up a potential season 3, where Ward may return to cause more trouble for the Pogues.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmZh6rrHRnJ%2BapqRjsLC5jpuss7JfnsBuw8Crm2abkaKys7vNZpicrKWWua3FjJ2cmpxdqbWmecSxp6Wno57DpnnTsKCsrF2eu2671K2cq2WSlrusv4ysnJqrn6N6c3s%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./sister-wives-couple-kody-and-robyn-brown-nix-plans-to-build-on-coyote-pass.html>&#171;&nbsp;Sister Wives couple Kody and Robyn Brown nix plans to build on Coyote Pass</a>
