She began to build a reputation for herself and finally began DJing full-time.</p><p>Samantha has performed as a DJ at events including the Super Bowl, the Sundance Film Festival, MTV’s New Year’s Eve show, the American Music Awards, and the Pan American Games.

Ronson co-produced the album with Jimmy Messer, the former guitarist for the glam rock band Goudie, and penned the song “Skyscrapers” with her brother Mark.</p><p>Samantha formed the pop band Ocean Park Standoff in 2016 with vocalist Ethan Thompson and drummer Pete Nappi, and the following year, they released a self-titled EP.
