It has been a nursery rhyme for a while. We have no idea where the song came from, as Pinkfong did not write the song; however, their re-edition of the song received a lot of positive feedback on social media.</strong></p><p>Baby shark Doo doo doo doo, baby shark is a famous nursery rhyme. The clip has already some individuals thinking that while speaking to a community college in California, the president of the United States experienced a brain spasm and began singing the kids' song. You know, there's a video going around the internet showing <strong>Joe Biden</strong> saying that he will sing the national anthem and then launching into the first few bars of Baby Shark. The video has become proof that the US president has dementia for some people.</p><p>The deep fake technology, which is essentially advanced Photoshop for moving visuals, was used to create the clip. Deep fake technology is being exploited in more sinister ways as it becomes more widely available and advanced. Concerns have been raised regarding the potential for them to be used to sway elections and propagate false information.</p><p>By the way, the purpose of this particular video wasn't to spread malicious falsehoods. It was just a prank, as its inventor informed the Associated Press. Anyone with half a brain cell could have deduced this from watching the video: it's full of deliberate indicators that something is off, jokes can spread quickly online, and disinformation isn't any less destructive just because it was intended as a joke.</p><p>As the song gained more popularity, public interest in Baby Shark, especially regarding the writer, has recently increased. The subject of the baby shark writer killing his wife has intrigued fans. Why is the subject so well-known? What was the real motive behind the song's writer killing his wife, Baby Shark? Let's uncover the reality.</p><p>Previously, we touched on the <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>stories</a></strong> of <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Michael J. Fox</a></strong>.</p><h2>There Is Currently No Information on Whether Baby Shark’s Writer Killed His Wife, as the Song’s Real Writer Is Still a Mystery!</h2><p>Since its initial upload more than four years ago, Baby Shark has held the title. The song's author is unknown; it has been a nursery <a href=# rel=noopener>rhyme</a> for a while, but after being sung by 10-year-old Korean-American singer <strong>Hope Segoine</strong>, it became a worldwide sensation.</p><p>It was created by the educational firm Pinkfong and featured fish-themed dance techniques. It first gained popularity in Southeast Asia before spreading to the US and Europe. In the US and the UK, it peaked at No. 32 and No. 6, respectively. In the song's 100-year existence, the phrase doo doo doo doo has been the subject of amputation, treachery, and a legal dispute.</p><p>Although <a href=# rel=noopener>Pinkfong</a> did not write the song, their re-edition of it received a lot of positive feedback on social media. Online reports claim that convicts were <a href=# rel=noopener>tortured</a> in prison in 2019 using the song. But once Pinkfong created his version, it was also utilized in numerous kid-friendly television programs as a prettier version.</p><p>As the author is still unknown, it would seem that the news of the author's wife's murder is also untrue. And we're not sure why the "baby shark writer killed wife" rumor has surfaced. Also, this song's popularity on YouTube grew significantly. In recent years, this song, which was sung by Korean actors, has gained popularity in a number of countries, including South Korea and Hong Kong.</p><p>It surpasses Despacito, the 2017 song by Puerto Rican pop artists <strong>Luis Fonsi</strong> and <strong>Daddy Yankee</strong>, with <strong>7.04 billion</strong> views. Its persistent doo-doo-doo-du-du-du-du chorus, which is just one minute and 21 seconds long, encourages countless repeats and adds to its record-breaking total. The song has been remixed numerous times, including once advocating handwashing during the coronavirus pandemic. The earworm has also inspired a spin-off live tour, souvenirs, books, and other things.</p><p>The music is in the public domain and not Pinkfong's property, although the latter was sued in 2019 by children's songwriter <strong>Jonathan Wright</strong>, who claimed copyright on a rendition of the song he had made in 2011 that was similar to Pinkfong's.</p><p>When three Oklahoma prison staff were charged with prisoner maltreatment last month after allegedly handcuffing detainees and forcing them to stand and listen to Baby Shark for as long as two hours, the song was at the center of yet another allegation of misconduct. According to district attorney <strong>David Prater</strong>, the detainees would have already been under undue emotional stress from the repeated song.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><p>In order to ascertain who, if anyone, owns the rights to the current version of Baby Shark, the popular song is currently in front of Korean courts in a copyright dispute between Only and SmartStudy/Pinkfong. On its side, SmartStudy maintains that it is the sole proprietor of the music. With more than 11 billion views as of July 2022, Pinkfong is the owner of the most popular YouTube video of all time, Baby Shark.</p><p><strong>Visit <a href=#>Celebs In-depth</a> for more <a href=#>interesting stories</a> about your favorite celebs.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FIp5ueqKSde6S7zGiZmpqpYsCprdGkZLCqmamys3nKoqOlnZRixKqyxGg%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./william-friedkins-final-film-makes-you-question-everything-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;William Friedkins Final Film Makes You Question Everything</a>
