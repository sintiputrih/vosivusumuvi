Brandon ran the ball 96 times for 423 yards and nine touchdowns during the 2006 season, averaging 4.4 yards per carry.</p><p>To that, he added 11 catches for 149 yards.

The Giants gave him the franchise tag on February 13, 2009.</p><p>A week later, he agreed to a four-year, $25 million contract with the Giants, and that year, he carried the most of the load.</p><p>Due to a knee injury, he was put on injured reserve on December 31, 2009. He received a $10,000 fine after throwing his helmet into the Lucas Oil Stadium stands on September 19, 2010.</p><p>In addition, he was announced as the Giants’ top running back for their game against the Jacksonville Jaguars on November 24, 2010.</p><p>He and the Giants took the field in Super Bowl XLVI at the end of the 2011 season.

After suffering a knee injury in training camp, he missed the first two months of the season and had little playing time after his comeback.</p><p>Brandon Jacobs played in two games and carried the ball five times for a total of seven yards, essentially serving as the third or fourth backup tailback.</p><p>Following many posts by him&nbsp;on social media platforms criticizing his lack of playing time, including one in which he said he was “on this team rotting away,” the 49ers banned him for the last three games of the same season. On December 31, 2012, the 49ers released him.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-233312 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographymask.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Brandon-Jacobs-poto-during-a-NFL-match-against-New-York-Jets.jpg alt="Brandon Jacobs " width=650 height=432 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-233312 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Brandon Jacobs photo during an NFL match against New York Jets (Source: Bleacher Report)</p><h4><span>The reality television shows, Shark Tank, and Impact Wrestling</span></h4><p>He made an appearance on episode #406 of ABC’s Shark Tank on October 19, 2012, together with Pro NRG creator Tania Patruno, to present the startup company’s protein supplement/energy drink and maybe secure some funding for the endeavor.</p><p>Additionally, during the February 16, 2012, broadcast of Impact Wrestling, he made an appearance.
