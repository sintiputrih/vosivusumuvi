id=introduction></span>Introduction&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Example is an English musician, singer, songwriter, rapper and record producer from London.</p><p>His name arose due to his initials being E.G., which is an abbreviation of the Latin phrase exempli gratia (“for example”).</p><p>As of January 2024, Example’s net worth is estimated to be $12 Million.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=early-life></span>Early Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Elliot John Gleave was born on the 20th of June, 1982, in London.</p><p>Gleave is the son of Elaine Johnston and Michael Gleave.</p><p>In a 2012 interview with The Guardian, he said “I was diagnosed with Asperger’s when I was younger. I was amazing with numbers, I had a photographic memory, and I hated reading fiction, preferring books on nature and history. All symptoms of mild autism.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=career></span>Career&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Example’s career kicked off after he released three singles in 2006, earning him attention from&nbsp;<a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/pete-tong-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=143533 data-wpel-link=internal><u>Pete Tong</u></a> and Zane Lowe on Radio 1.&nbsp;</p><p>Soon after, he signed a deal with The Beats and released the single “Vile” in response to Lily Allen’s number one hit, “Smile.”&nbsp;</p><p>His first official release through The Beats was “What We Made,” and the music video for it was filmed in Chornobyl, Ukraine.&nbsp;</p><p>Example’s second Beats single was “You Can’t Rap” in 2007, followed by a re-release of his self-released single “I Don’t Want To.”&nbsp;</p><p>After the Beats label went under, Example started self-releasing his work again and even tried stand-up comedy in 2008.&nbsp;</p><h3>Finding Commercial Success</h3><p>Example had his first commercial success in September 2009 with “Watch the Sun Come Up,” the lead single on his second album,&nbsp;Won’t Go Quitely.&nbsp;</p><p>This single debuted at no. 20 on the UK Singles Chart and was followed by the single “Won’t Go Quitely,” which debuted at no. 6.&nbsp;</p><p>When his second album dropped, it debuted at no. 4 on the UK Albums Chart, thanks to the prior popularity of his singles.&nbsp;</p><p>In May 2010, Example collaborated with <a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/ed-sheeran-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=143534 data-wpel-link=internal><u>Ed Sheeran</u></a> on a song about Nandos, one of the most popular restaurants in the UK.&nbsp;</p><p>A year later, Example released the first single from his third album, “Changed the Way You Kiss Me,” which debuted at no. 1 on the UK charts.&nbsp;</p><p>His third album, Playing in the Shadows, dropped in September 2011 at no. 1 in the UK and no. 6 in Ireland.&nbsp;</p><h3>Hit Singles And Albums</h3><p>In 2012, Example wrote “Chasing The Sun” for The Wanted, which was later remixed by <a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/hardwell-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=143535 data-wpel-link=internal><u>Hardwell</u></a> and hit no. 2 on the UK Singles Chart.&nbsp;</p><p>The same year, Example signed a record deal in the US with Mercury, a branch of Universal, with the goal of growing his American audience.&nbsp;</p><p>2012 was also the year he released his fourth studio album,&nbsp;The Evolution of Man, which peaked at no. 13 on the UK charts.&nbsp;</p><p>He followed this up by debuting the lead single from his fifth album in 2013, titled “All the Wrong Places,” at a concert in Auckland.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2013, he signed with the UK division of Epic Records and appeared at the Glastonbury Festival, where he played tracks from his upcoming album.&nbsp;</p><p>Like many of the <a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/richest-singers-world/ data-lasso-id=143536 data-wpel-link=internal><u>richest singers in the world</u></a>, Example became involved in charity work, serving as an ambassador for the Teenage Cancer Trust.&nbsp;</p><p>His fifth album,&nbsp;Live Life Living, was dropped in 2014, which once again became a hit on the charts in the UK and Ireland.&nbsp;</p><h3>Collaborations And Success</h3><p>Before his 2014 tour, Example revealed he was collaborating with <a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/netsky-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=143537 data-wpel-link=internal><u>Netsky</u></a> and Sigma on his upcoming sixth album.&nbsp;</p><p>While he took a brief break in 2015 to spend time with his family, the following year, he came back and announced the single “Later.”&nbsp;</p><p>In 2018, he released five singles before independently releasing his mixtape,&nbsp;Bangers & Ballads, which has since been deemed to be his sixth album.&nbsp;</p><p>His 2019 single “All Night” hit no. 26 on the UK Dance Chart, marking his first chart appearance since 2015.&nbsp;</p><p>Shortly after, he released the single “Back on the Wreck,” his first self-produced single that he didn’t provide vocals for.&nbsp;</p><p>That year also saw him release his seventh album, Some Nights Last For Days, which he quickly turned out during quarantine.&nbsp;</p><h3>Hard At Work</h3><p>Example <a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://www.billboard.com/pro/example-signs-with-bmg-exclusive/ data-lasso-id=143538 data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer"><u>signed with BMG</u></a> in 2021 and quickly dropped “Every Single Time,” the first single from his eighth upcoming album.&nbsp;</p><p>Throughout 2022, he consistently released new singles from the album, many of which featured collaborations with other artists.&nbsp;</p><p>While he wasn’t making tracks with the <a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/top-20-richest-rappers-world/ data-lasso-id=143539 data-wpel-link=internal><u>richest rappers in the world</u></a>, he did collab with Lucy Lucy, Kanine, and Penny Ivy.&nbsp;</p><p>His eighth album, We May Grow Old But We Never Grow Up, was released in June and hit no. 5 on the UK Dance Albums Chart.&nbsp;</p><p>Most recently, he appeared at the Glastonbury Festival in 2023, with headliners including <a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/elton-john-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=143540 data-wpel-link=internal><u>Elton John</u></a> and Guns N’ Roses.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=example-net-worth></span>Example Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As of January 2024, Example’s net worth is

EDM got big, we went to America with it which I think was a little bit early, then at the end of 2012 it got massive. <a href=# data-lasso-id=2934 data-wpel-link=internal>Calvin [Harris]</a> wasn’t even getting played a lot on the radio at this stage.”&nbsp;<strong>– Example&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“We had a couple more hits, and then it was like… I’m saying this with hindsight now… at the time it felt easy because I never tried to write hits – I just went in the studio and had fun. Obviously, I was going through some dark stuff, there was a breakup, I was partying too much…”&nbsp;<strong>– Example&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“I got married and had kids, “Won’t Go Quietly was like the breakthrough album, then it was basically four albums in four years. It was an amazing run.”&nbsp;<strong>– Example&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“I grew up in a south London school where everyone would do these rap battles in the playground, but I was an indie kid at heart. So I made that album. That’s where it plateaued a bit. I reckon if I’d made three more ‘Changed the Way You Kissed Me’s I’d be even bigger now.”&nbsp;<strong>– Example&nbsp;</strong></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=3-life-lessons-from-example></span>3 Life Lessons from Example&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.wealthygorilla.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Example-Success-Lessons-800x450.jpg></p><p>Now that you know all about Example’s net worth, and how he achieved success; let’s take a look at some of the lessons we can learn from him:&nbsp;</p><h3>1.
