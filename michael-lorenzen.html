Lorenzen made just his second start with the team that acquired him in a trade last month, and he struck out five, gave out four walks, and threw 124 pitches.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Since Cole Hamels in 2015, Lorenzen’s no-hitter is the first one thrown by a Phillie. In his final game with Philadelphia before being dealt to the Texas Rangers, Hamels threw a no-hitter. The fourteenth in club history was Lorenzen’s.</p><p>The Nationals were no-hit for the first time since moving to Washington, D.C., in 2005 during the contest on Wednesday.</p><p>For the first time in his career, Lorenzen, 31, was an All-Star this season for the Detroit Tigers.

In their 2-0 victory over the Cleveland Guardians, Valdez threw the 16th no-hitter in Astros history with 93 pitches while facing the necessary 27 batters. Last month, Matt Manning and the Detroit Tigers collaborated to throw a no-hitter. Domingo Germán, a pitcher with the New York Yankees, had a perfect game in June against the Oakland Athletics. Since then, he has taken a break from the squad for the rest of the season and entered a treatment facility.</p><p>Wednesday night, the Phillies scored three runs in the first inning thanks to RBI doubles from Bryce Harper and Nick Castellanos and a two-run home run. In his first at-bat in the Major League, Weston Wilson homered in the second inning, and Castellanos added another home run in the third. The Phillies now lead 5-0 as a result of that. The final two innings saw RBI singles from Alec Bohm and Johan Rojas, helping Philadelphia to a seven-run victory.</p><p>The Phillies’ victory was their seventh in their last 10 games. They presently occupy the top NL wild-card berth but are 10.5 games behind the Atlanta Braves in the NL East.</p><p><strong>Also Read :</strong></p><ul><li><a href=#>Nick Kerr Wiki, Wikipedia, Warriors, Full Name, Memes, Middle Name, Age, Stats, Dad</a></li><li><a href=#>Weston Wilson Wiki, Wikipedia, Phillies, Wife, Stats, Player, Contract, Family</a></li><li><a href=#>Johnny Cash Ethnicity, Wikipedia, Wiki, First Wife, Children, Height, Death, Children, Marriages, Net Worth</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmignpe0tnrNnqtopZmYtaKxy2ajqKqVo8emuo4%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./new-york-literary-readings-erotica-heaven-tonight-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;New Yorkers Are Reading Smut And Their Audience Is Loving It</a>
