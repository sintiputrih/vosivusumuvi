An interesting fact about him is that he is the descendant of the infamous Allen Clan of Carrol County in Virginia.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Beamer-deep-in-tought-300x200.jpg><p>Likewise, Frank’s great-uncle named Floyd Allen fired rounds of a gunshot in a courtroom that killed five people, including the judge, prosecutor, and the county sheriff, due to his ill-temper.</p><p>When Frank was seven years old, he almost died due to a fire accident. As per reports, Frank used a push broom to maintain burning trash in place. He did not see the fire in the broom and placed the broom back in the garage.</p><p>The broom caught a small can of gasoline and caused a fire. His eleven-year-old brother saved Frank by rolling his body around the ground.</p><p>As a result of this incident, Frank had to go through skin reconstruction surgery multiple times and has permanent scarring in his shoulders, chest, and right side of the neck.</p><p>As a teenager, Frank Beamer attended a high school in Hillsville, Virginia. Additionally, his brilliance in sports earned him eleven varsity letters in three different sports: football, basketball, and baseball.&nbsp;</p><p>Frank Beamer went to college to Virginia Tech, where he played football as the starting quarterback for three years, from 1966 to 1968.&nbsp;</p><p>For his graduate studies, he chose Radford University, and at the same time, he worked as the Radford High School assistant coach. This is where his journey as a coach officially began.</p><p><strong><a href=#>Nick Saban Bio: Quick Facts, Professional Life, Net Worth & Salary >></a></strong></p><h2>Starting of a Great Career – Frank Beamer</h2><h3>Getting Started</h3><p>Frank started his journey as a coach by becoming an assistant coach at the Radford High School in 1969 when he joined Radford University for his Graduate Studies.&nbsp;</p><p>His first college coaching opportunity came with the University of Maryland, College Park as a graduate assistant.</p><p>After spending a season there, he was promoted as the assistant coach at The Citadel, The Military College of North Carolina.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Beamer-with-his-colleagues-300x196.jpg><p>There, he spent seven seasons. So, in the last two seasons at The Citadel, he was promoted as the defensive coordinator.</p><p>After spending seven seasons there, he was hired as the Murray State University defensive coordinator under the head coach Mike Gottfried.</p><p>Frank got promoted as the Head Coach of the Murray State University football team after two years. Hence, he worked as the head coach for six years, where he amassed the record of 42-23-2(.642).&nbsp;</p><p>After spending eight years in Murray State Team, Frank got hired as the head coach of Virginia Tech in 1986. He replaced Bill Dooley, the best coach Virginia Tech had to date, who had to resign after multiple rules violations.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Jürgen Klinsmann- Football Career, Coach & Charity Work >></strong></a></p><p>Thus, Frank Beamer signed a four-year contract with Virginia State with an annual income of $80,000.</p><p>Due to the violations of rules Dooley had made, the Virginia Tech Hokies could only give out 85 scholarships in 1987 and 1988 and only 17 new scholarships only in 1989.</p><p>Moreover, this rule caused a huge setback in the Hookies team. So, Frank only completed a combined score of 5-17 in 1987 and 1988. After his first six seasons, Frank’s record was 24-40-2 with a win percentage of only .385.</p><p>Hokies’ athletic director Dave Braine believed in Beamer and thought he deserved more time to prove himself. And as Braine thought, Hokies started performing better under Beamer’s watch again.&nbsp;</p><h3>Making a Name in Coaching</h3><p>After he began success, the Virginia Tech Hokies began to win matches after matches. Hokies went 9-3 and got victory over the Independence Bowl, the fourth time in school history to have won nine games in a season.</p><p>From 1993 to the 2000s, the Hokies had gathered a total record of 75-21. They also appeared in the major bowl for the first time in school history.&nbsp;</p><p>Hokies reached their top level when they completed a season with 11-0 and earned a spot in the 2000 Sugar Bowl. Therefore, they competed against Florida State for the BCS National Championship.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Final-Pep-Talk-to-the-team-300x200.jpg><p>But, the Hokies lost to the Florida State in the early fourth quarter. They finished the season by placing third in the AP Poll and Second in the Coaches’ Poll.&nbsp;</p><p>This was the highest-ranking they had received in their history and highest for the Divison I team belonging from the Commonwealth.</p><h3>ACC Championships – Beaver’s Vision</h3><p>The early 2000s were golden for Virginia Tech because they maintained their bowl eligibility throughout the time and won the 2004 ACC Championship in its first time playing in the league.</p><p>The years from 2005 to 2011 were fantastic for the Virginia Tech Hokies as they won at least 10 games every season. This was special as they were the only team in the entire country to do so.</p><p>Speaking personally for Frank Beamer, his record from 1993 to 2011 was 185-58 with a winning percentage of .761. During this period, the winning percentage was the fourth highest in the country.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Frank-Beamer-celebrating-300x195.jpg><p>In the 2012 to 2015 seasons under Frank, the Hookies finished their seasons with a winning record and an opportunity to bid in the bowl.</p><p>On November 1, 2015, Frank Beamer officially resigned from his position as the Hokies’ head coach. He had a long coaching career and an equally long history with the Virginia Tech Hokies.&nbsp;</p><p>In his last game, he won with 55-52 over Tulsa in the Independence Bowl. As an honor to him, he has carried off the field in the final regular-season game to become eligible.</p><p>To replace him, Virginia Tech hired Justin Fuente, the ex-coach of the University of Memphis, at the 2015 season.</p><h2>Frank Beamer – Awards and Accolades</h2><p>Throughout the years, Frank Beamer had a quite impressive run as the Coach.
