They had a lot of chemistry in all of their scenes together.</p><p>After Wonders and Davidson broke up, Wonders shared a photo on her Instagram account on August 28, 2023, according to The Daily Mail. She was on vacation and seemed happy and relaxed. While of course fans can guess that both actors were upset by the breakup, she definitely looked great.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/chase-sui-wonders-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It seems that Wonders has been getting out and having fun.

She might be keeping that quiet, or she might still be single.</p><p>Chase Sui Wonders's life definitely looks different right now since actors aren't filming any projects because of the WGA/SAF-AFTRA strike that began on May 2nd, 2023.

She said, "I’m just getting back into town, getting my life in order. I’m writing today. I’ve been working on this TV script for a while. We’re trying to push it across the finish line and get all the kinks out."</p><p>Wonders hasn't shared any more information about her writing. It's possible that she is still in the midst of the creative process and there haven't been any updates to share.

In 2021, she said in an interview with W Magazine that when she lived with her mom at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, she did a lot of drawing.</p><p>Wonders said, "Even if I didn’t do anything all day, I would make an attempt to draw because even as quiet and mundane and maddening as that time was, drawing taps into a meditative state,” she said.</p><p>“It’s such a quiet and calm act and not always stimulating, but I tap into a state where I’m spending time and attention doing something and it feels like a recharge. You can just laser your focus in on something creative. I definitely turn to it as a coping mechanism.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chase-sui-wonders-pete-davidson-bodies-bodies-bodies-01-700x400-1.jpg><p>Chase Sui Wonders isn't able to do any more promotion for her latest TV shows Bupkis, which also stars Pete Davidson, or City on Fire. Her next project is a movie called Little Death that also stars Jena Malone and David Schwimmer. According to the movie's IMDb page, it's currently in post-production.
