They became close very quickly, resulting in their marriage in December 1993.</p><h2 id=shania-married-her-first-husband-and-made-music-magic>Shania Married Her First Husband And Made Music Magic</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shania Twain — born Eileen Regina Edwards — was adopted by her stepfather Jerry Twain after her mother remarried when the singer was only four years old.</p><p>Her name was Eileen Twain until she was signed to a record label in 1992. Only then did she change her name to Shania — an Ojibwa word that meant ‘on my way.’</p><p>And she was on her way; Shania’s marriage to Mutt Lange was the consequence of what could only be called a whirlwind romance.</p><p>The fact that they had a spark cannot be denied considering that their first call lasted for three hours during which they were just singing or playing their original songs to each other. They had their first and only child Eja (pronounced Asia) D’Angelo Lange on August 12, 2001.</p><p>“I didn’t want to be too forward,” Shania said about her first call with Mutt, in her Netflix documentary Not Just A Girl in which she revealed her worst fears, “but in my mind, I’m saying, ‘Oh wow, if this guy made my music sound like that, that would be the dream’.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The No One Needs To Know singer’s career reached new heights with the release of her second album The Woman In Me, which she either wrote or co-wrote with Lange.</p><p>The couple’s chemistry garnered four albums: The Woman in Me (1995), Come On Over (1997), Up! (2002), and Greatest Hits (2004).</p><h2 id=shania-39-s-best-friend-grew-close-with-the-singer-39-s-husband>Shania's Best Friend Grew Close With The Singer's Husband</h2><p>Shania Twain, also known as the ‘Queen Of Country Music’ and rightly so, has always depended on music as she finds solace in it. “I like expressing myself through music … that’s the way I express myself best,” she told the Independent in a 2017 interview <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">while talking about her first post-divorce album Now</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Twain-Lange family moved to Switzerland in the 1990s and this was where You’re Still The One Singer met Marie-Anne Thiébaud, who was hired by Shania as an assistant who would help her take care of her home and family.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Shania Twain May Not Have Made Music For 15 Years, But That Doesn't Mean She's Done Singing</a></span></p><p>It didn’t take long for the two families to become close. Everything was going well between Shania and her husband so when Robert suddenly asked for a divorce in 2008, the Rock This Country! the singer was shocked, even more so since Lange refused to give her a proper reason.</p><p>However, truth prevailed and soon, Shania find out about Robert’s affair with her then-best friend Mary-Anne, through none other than Frédéric, who was then Mary-Anne’s husband. Frédéric was the first person to find out about the affair through receipts and phone bills in his wife’s suitcase.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I did discover the affair with my wife and Mutt," Thiébaud had told Oprah Winfrey. "I said, 'Guys, now you have to tell [Shania]. This is ridiculous. You just owe her that'."</p><p>When Shania confronted her friend about it, Marie-Anne denied the accusation and changed her phone number so that Twain wouldn’t be able to contact her again.</p><h2 id=shania-eventually-moved-on-with-her-former-friend-39-s-husband>Shania Eventually Moved On With Her Former Friend's Husband</h2><p>Having a rough childhood, losing her parents, and <a href=#>almost losing her voice when she was at the peak of her career</a> could not do what betrayal and separation from her husband of 14 years did to Shania Twain.</p><p>“I needed the wake-up,” the country superstar said to Oprah Winfrey of her divorce while discussing her moving-forward process during a 2011 interview.</p><p><a href=#>Twain, who is powerful enough to teach a life lesson to British singer Harry Styles</a> without knowing that she has, was bound to make a comeback in the music industry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Although her divorce did leave an impact on her career</a>, it wasn’t strong enough to halt the progress of the trailblazer that Shania Twain is.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Tia Mowry's Divorce Will Affect Her Life And Career</a></span></p><p>The Canadian singer had slightly more trouble moving on in her personal life. After her divorce, the only person who could understand Shania's pain was the other jilted lover, Frédéric Thiébaud.</p><p>Their friendship might have been the result of the pain they had suffered, but it was also the only thing that could heal them both from the damage they had survived.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It wasn’t long before Frédéric caught feelings for the country singer, but Twain had a hard time accepting his love.
