These women have worked in finance, real estate, cheerleading, education, and even competitive aerobics. They come from both big cities (New York, NY) and tiny communities (Estill Springs, TN), and their musical preferences range from classic rock to Harry Styles. (One of them even attended a concert by the Beatles.) And they are all at least 60 years of age.</p><p>As always we relied on our spoiler king Reality Steve to give four names of who will see the hometown date with the Golden Bachelor’s leading man. However, Reality Steve revealed that filming of the show began on August 3 and hometowns kicked off three weeks later.</p><p>Reality Steve mentioned that only one month would be spent filming, thus this timeline works out wonderfully. For Gerry’s season, there were just three home dates.</p><p>One of the three women is Faith Martin. According to her short bio, she hailed from Benton City, Washington. She is a high school teacher and ” ‘Faith loves riding her horse, Liberty, through the mountains.’ Oooh, she’s outdoorsy… just like our Golden Bachelor!”</p><p>The other two women Gerry will have his hometown dates with are <a href=#>Theresa</a> and <a href=#>Leslie</a>.</p><p>After the names of 22 women were made official, Faith took to her Facebook and wrote, “Thank you so much, Monica!
