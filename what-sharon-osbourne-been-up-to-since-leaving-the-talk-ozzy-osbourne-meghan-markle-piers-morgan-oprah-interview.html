href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Sharon Osbourne</strong></a>, was a lead host of CBS's daytime show, The Talk. The show has been a daytime TV mainstay for years, and credited much of its success to the frankness of its down-to-earth presenting team - who were rarely afraid to speak their minds on popular and divisive issues currently in the media.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Sharon Osbourne Admits To Beating Ozzy Osbourne, And Fans Are Still In Shock</a></span></p><p>Things changed, however, in March of this year, when Sharon came under fire for defending friend <strong>Piers Morgan</strong> after he made comments criticising <strong>Meghan, Duchess of Sussex</strong> after her big <strong>Oprah Winfrey</strong> interview. A clip was also dragged up of Sharon claiming <strong>Meghan Markle</strong> "ain't black", which only further added to the controversy. Amid huge backlash for the comments, CBS was forced to terminate Sharon's contract after over ten years on the show. Since then, it's been a tricky few months for the former music manager and author, who has been a feature of popular US television for over two decades, having starred in MTV's The Osbournes and judged on America's Got Talent. Let's take a look at how Sharon's been spending her time since the shock departure.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-39-s-appeared-on-game-show-39-let-39-s-make-a-deal-39><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>She's Appeared On Game Show 'Let's Make A Deal'</span></h2><p>Since leaving The Talk, Sharon's made an appearance on the classic variety game show Let's Make A Deal, according to her Wikipedia page. Sharon has made appearances on numerous shows of its kind during her career, regularly joining as a judge or panellist to share her wisdom.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'The Talk': Newly Leaked Audio Suggests Sharon Osbourne Was Targeted By A Set Up</a></span></p><h2 id=helping-ozzy-through-his-recovery-has-been-her-priority><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Helping Ozzy Through His Recovery Has Been Her Priority</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sharon's also been spending more time with husband Ozzy and supporting him through his recovery from pneumonia and a fall he suffered back in 2019. Ozzy also suffers from Parkinson's disease, and is preparing for a big operation soon, which he hopes will allow him to return to the stage.</p><p>‘The thing I’m most excited about is my hubby getting back on stage.

We need some cute pics if this happens!</p><h2 id=she-39-s-advising-on-a-biopic-about-her-and-ozzy-39-s-marriage><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>She's Advising On A Biopic About Her And Ozzy's Marriage</span></h2><p>Sharon's also been working on an upcoming biopic which will explore her volatile forty-year marriage to husband Ozzy, and promises that the picture will be brutally honest about their relationship and history of violence toward each other.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The project is all "about Ozzy's and my life, how we came together in the early days and our volatile relationship: All the fights, all the makeups, all the fights, all the arrests, all the everything – and it's a love story.”</p><p>“Our fights were legendary,” Sharon told the<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Daily Mail during a recent interview</a>. “We would beat the sh*t out of each other. It stopped, must be 20 years ago, but we had a good run.”</p><p>“People are going to watch it and go, ‘This isn’t allowed. They shouldn't behave that way and put it on film,’” Sharon says. “But [we're] only talking the truth. Some people have volatile relationships and ours was very volatile.” As for what's changed, she said “you grow. You grow to a stage where it sickens you. You grow to a stage where it physically makes you sick … but when you're young and, you know, you're fighting the world, it's different.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans React To Learning Sharon And Ozzy Osbourne Used To ‘Beat One Another Up’</a></span></p><h2 id=sharon-has-had-therapy-since-leaving-the-show><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Sharon Has Had Therapy Since Leaving The Show</span></h2><p>Leaving The Talk so suddenly, and amid such a hostile reception for airing her views, was hard on Sharon, and she struggled to deal with the mental fallout of her sudden departure after so many years. Being 'canceled' on social media caused particular issues for her, and she was forced to hire 24-hour-security following a series of death threats made. Suffering mentally, she also made the decision to seek mental health support, following the advice of friend and former co-host <strong>Sara Gilbert</strong>, and underwent months of ketamine therapy to deal with the emotional trauma.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>'I went through three months of therapy,' she said. 'I had ketamine treatment and I got it all out. All the tears and everything that I felt, you know.

What am I going to do? Am I going to be a judge again? No. I'm not going to go on another TV show that's talk because I know right now it's not a safe place to be.
