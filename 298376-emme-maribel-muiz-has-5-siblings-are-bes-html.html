Their relationship lasted for ten years before their divorce was finalized in 2014. The couple was blessed with two children in 2008, with Emme being one-half of the fraternal twins, including her brother Maximilian Muñiz.</p><p class=dh>In addition to the five siblings, they have three step-siblings from their mother's recent marriage to Hollywood leading man Ben Affleck. Affleck shares his three children with his longtime partner, actress Jennifer Garner. Emme has since developed a close bond with her step-sister, Seraphina Affleck.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Emme's Dad Has 6 Children, and Her Mom Has 2</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Emme is part of one big family made up of many <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/pictures/marc-anthonys-family-guide-meet-his-6-children/>siblings</a>, mainly from their father's side. Emme's father, Anthony, has had six children with three different women, two from each woman. The singer's first child was with his girlfriend, Debbie Rosado. The couple named her Arianna Muñiz, and she was born in June 1994.</p><p class=dh>While they were still dating, they adopted a son, Chase Muñiz. The New York-born singer has been married four times. After breaking up with Rosado, he married his first wife, Torres, with whom he has two children.</p><p class=dh>The first of the couple's two sons, Cristian Marcus, was born in 2001. Their second child and Anthony's fourth is Ryan Adrian Muñiz, born on August 4, 2003.</p><p class=dh>Anthony <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.nickiswift.com/158555/the-untold-truth-of-j-los-daughter/>married</a> Lopez in 2014, and together they had twins, Emme and Maximilian David Muñiz, on February 22, 2008. Their birth drew massive attention. People Magazine even paid $6 million for the first photo of the newborn babies.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Emme Maribel Muñiz Has Three Step-Siblings Too</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>In July 2022, Emme's mother married Ben Affleck, and they automatically added three more siblings to their already-long list. Their stepfather has <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://pagesix.com/article/jennifer-lopez-and-ben-afflecks-kids-meet-their-5-children/>three kids</a> from his previous marriage to Jennifer Garner between 2005 to 2018. The eldest of Affleck's kids is his daughter, Violet. She was born on December 1, 2005.</p><p class=dh>Violet has already warmed up to her stepmom, who she has been photographed with on several occasions. After Violet came Seraphina Rose Elizabeth Affleck on January 6, 2009. She is described as the most outgoing of his children and also tops the mischief list. Despite her parents' divorce, she has remained close to her father.</p><p class=dh>Seraphina is also reportedly close to her younger brother, Samuel Garner Affleck, with whom she spends a lot of time.

Apparently, the duo has a lot in common. One of the most noticeable things is their fashion taste which looks quite similar on many levels. They are both into casual jeans and large shoes.</p><p class=dh>Besides fashion choices, a source also <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/emme-muniz-seraphina-affleck-are-besties-inside-their-bond/>informed</a> Life & Style that Emme and Seraphina enjoy similar music and are "definitely besties."
