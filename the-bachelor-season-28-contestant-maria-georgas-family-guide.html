It was a very scary situation.”</p><p>Maria explained to Joey that her mom went through a “big depression” after the accident and was not around much during her childhood. While their relationship is still strained, Maria admitted that her dad had advocated for the women to strengthen their bond.</p><p>“My mom and I are still a work in progress,” she said. “It’s been so much better.
