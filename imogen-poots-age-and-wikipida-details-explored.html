She played Tammy in the post-apocalyptic horror film 28 Weeks Later (2007), Linda Keith in the Jimi Hendrix biopic Jimi: All Is by My Side (2013), Debbie Raymond in the Paul Raymond biopic The Look of Love (2013), and Julia Maddon in the American action film Need for Speed (2014).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-imogen-poots-biography><strong>Imogen Poots biography</strong></h2><p>Imogen Gay Poots was born in June 1989 at the Queen Charlotte’s and Chelsea Hospital in Hammersmith, London. Her parents are Trevor Poots, a current affairs television producer from Belfast, and Fiona Goodall, a journalist and voluntary worker from Bolton.</p><p>Imogen has an older brother named Alex, who works as a model. She grew up in Chiswick, West London, and received a private education. Imogen attended Bute House Preparatory School for Girls in Brook Green, Queen’s Gate School in South Kensington, and Latymer Upper School in Hammersmith.</p><p>Initially, Imogen had aspirations of becoming a veterinary surgeon. However, during her work experience, she fainted at the sight of veterinary surgery, leading her to abandon this career path.</p><p>Despite this setback, Imogen excelled academically and achieved three A grades at A-level. In 2008, she was accepted into the Courtauld Institute of Art. However, she decided to defer her enrollment for two years to pursue her acting career.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-imogen-poots-career><strong>Imogen Poots career</strong></h2><p>Poots made her first on-screen appearance in a 2004 episode of Casualty and had a minor role in the 2006 film V for Vendetta.

Since then, she has appeared in various films including Cracks in 2009, Centurion in 2010, and the 2011 remake of Fright Night where she played the female lead alongside Anton Yelchin. Despite not having formal training as an actress, Poots has honed her skills through practical experience, resulting in her being described as “compellingly natural” in front of the camera, according to Giles Hattersley.</p><p>In 2011, Poots was selected by fashion house Chloé to feature in a campaign for their fragrance, which was photographed by Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin. The following year, she was chosen to star in an advertising campaign directed by Sofia Coppola for a collaboration between fashion label Marni and high street retailer H&M.</p><p>In 2012, Poots portrayed the acrimonious young violinist Alexandra Gelbart in the film A Late Quartet, alongside Catherine Keener and Philip Seymour Hoffman. The following year, she appeared in multiple films including Greetings from Tim Buckley, Filth, The Look of Love, and portrayed Linda Keith in the Jimi Hendrix biopic Jimi: All Is by My Side, starring André Benjamin as Hendrix. In 2014, Poots starred in the romantic comedy That Awkward Moment and the action film Need for Speed, which was based on a video game series. She also played the character Jess in the black comedy A Long Way Down. In 2015, she appeared in She’s Funny That Way with Jennifer Aniston and Knight of Cups with Cate Blanchett. Poots has been cast in the film adaptation of Jess Walter’s novel Beautiful Ruins and reunited with Anton Yelchin for the film Green Room.
